I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I received my BS degrees in Electrical Engineering and Physics from [Boğaziçi University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en_US/) in 2022. My research interests include spectrum sharing and allocation, digital signal processing and the application of machine learning techniques in wireless communications.
