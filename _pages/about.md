I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I received my BS degrees in Electrical Engineering and Physics from [Boğaziçi University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en_US/) in 2022. My research interests include digital signal processing, applications of machine learning techniques in wireless communications and spectrum sharing and allocation.
