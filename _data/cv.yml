      institution: Georgia Institute of Technology
      year: 2023-Present
      description:
        - Took part in the implementation of an ambient scatter communications system. Worked on a complex-valued neural network demodulation technique in Python using PyTorch that outperforms conventional de-
modulation techniques such as matched filtering.
        - Improving existing electromagnetic wave propagation models by applying regularized regression-based error
correction to the models considering channel and propagation characteristics in Python (PyTorch) and MAT-
LAB. Includes feature design & engineering and a multilayer regression model. The proposed model enables
a 58% to 87% reduction in loss difference (error) variance.
