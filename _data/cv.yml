    - title: PhD in ECE
      institution: Georgia Institute of Technology, USA
      year: 2023-Present
      description:
        - Took part in the implementation of an ambient scatter communications system. Worked on a complex-
          valued neural network demodulation technique in Python using PyTorch that outperforms conventional de-
          modulation techniques such as matched filtering.
        - Improving existing electromagnetic wave propagation models by applying regularized regression-based error
          correction to the models considering channel and propagation characteristics in Python (PyTorch) and MATLAB.
          Includes feature design & engineering and a multilayer regression model. The proposed model enables
          a 58% to 87% reduction in loss difference (error) variance.
        - Designing digital spectrum twins for tracking historical and current usage of radio spectrum and predicting
          future patterns and usage. Designing aggregation rules to combine received signal strength, variance, duty
          cycle, and confidence values for various radio users in a region of interest using georeferenced maps. Utilized
          GIS, OSM, Python, and MATLAB.

      institution: Bogazici University, Turkey
      year: 2016-2022
      description:
        - Done undergraduate thesis on "A Comparison Between GNN Architectures and Implementation on Brain Connectomes".
          Used Python/PyTorch and Julia for node classification on a citation network and graph classification on brain
          connectomes structured as graphs. Showed that graph isomorphism networks (GIN) outperform graph convolutional
          networks (GCN) in graph classification tasks thanks to their isomorphic neighbor aggregation and graph readout
          operations.
